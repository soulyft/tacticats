Tacticats is a tic-tac-toe/checkers combination WebGL made with Unity

Tacticats is my debut game, created for the Ludwig Jam 2023. This game is a fusion of tic-tac-toe and checkers, featuring chess-style pieces representing Ludwig, QT, Ders, and COOTS. Each piece can move one space at a time and jump over pieces of the same color (Ludwig over Ludwig, QT over QT, and cats over cats). Two players take turns moving pieces to try and get three in a row for victory.

This game requires two players and can only be played locally, meaning that players must be in the same physical location or use a platform like Discord or chat to play remotely. I plan to keep this game open source, and welcome contributions from anyone who wants to add server/network capability.


Everything was made in Unity by myself (Corey Lofthus aka souLyft) with a lot of scripting/tutorial help from ChatGPT.
